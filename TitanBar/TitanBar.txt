TitanBar Known Issues/Limitations:
	- Player Location (Player location is not accessible in API. It's currently based on chat channel, so it will only work if any one of those channel is active: 'Trade', 'Regional', 'RP', 'OOC' or 'LFF'.)
	- Equipment score (Score based on item Quality & Toughness)
	- Equipment durability (Item min & max durability are not accessible in API. It's currently based on item wear state.)
	- Server Time is based on user defined GMT.
	- TitanBar set to bottom. It will be over UI element because UI element can't be moved in-game.
	- TitanBar auto always hide not working when exiting TitanBar menu. (when not selecting anything)
	- Auto sizing label & control is not quite perfect, some time as lot of space.
	- Icon are always in front (LOTRO stretch issue), so moving other control over each other is not recommended.
	- LOTRO points not updating when user spend some points in the lotro store. (LOTRO points not available in API and no text in chat when spending)
	- Turbine.Gameplay.LocalPlayer.GetEquipment() not working properly again. (LOTRO API issue)
